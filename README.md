# Description of the Jokes app

This project includes two parts - frontend app written in React and backend written using Sinatra and Active Record. In this README.md file, you find the description of the frontend part. 

Backend repository is located on https://github.com/shnatya/phase-3-sinatra-react-project

Jokes app allows users to store their jokes, filter jokes by category and delete jokes by fetching requests to Sinatra backend.

In order to add a new joke, push **Add a joke**, then type in a question, answer, your username, and categories through comma. A joke might belong to one or more categories. For example, here is a joke-question: “What’s worse than finding a worm in your apple?” and its answer is “finding half a worm”. This joke belongs to “Animals, plants” categories. Every user desides what categories his/her joke belongs to.
